# SwiftGimbal

A small Swift project that implements the **Gimbal Platform SDK (v1.30.1 11/19/2014)**. This app aims to show others how to get the SDK up and running in Swift. It focuses on Proximity detection and employs the FYXVisitDelegate. Arrivals, departures and sightings are handled by the rather simple GimbalBeaconManager. 

For further help look for me as unkowed in #iosdev or #iphonedev on irc.freenode.net.

_**This project has been updated for the iOS 8.3 SDK using Xcode 6.3**_

## To Run SwiftGimbal
<br>
This project assumes that you've setup your Gimbal Beacons with the Series 10 (or 20) Recommended configuration. For further information: [Configure a Gimbal Beacon for use with the Gimbal SDK](http://gimbal.com/doc/proximity/ios.html#beacon_configuration).

To successfully range there is no need to modify any code. However, you must complete a few steps outlined in the [Gimbal Proximity Quickstart](http://gimbal.com/doc/ios_proximity_quickstart.html), and you must modify a few files found in the project.

1. [Create a Developer Account in the Gimbal Manager](https://manager.gimbal.com/login/users/sign_up)

2. [Create a new Gimbal Application](http://gimbal.com/doc/ios_proximity_quickstart.html). You must use a new unique **_Bundle ID_** for your Gimbal Application. In the Gimbal Manager dashboard, open your application so you see the information below.<br><br>

	**_Things to note:_**
	a. Bundle ID
	b. Gimbal Production API Key	
	c. Application ID
	d. Gimbal Secret
	e. Callback urls
	<br><br>
3. Change the project's **_bundle ID_** to the same bundle ID of the Gimbal Application

7. (Optional) In the **_Info.plist_** Change the text in **_NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription_** that will appear when the application prompts the user to allow Location Services to access the user's location.
